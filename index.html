  <p>Much of my business analysis experience falls in the manufacturing sector which has provided me additional training in <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/what-is-lean-manufacturing">lean principles</a>.
    My passion is data. The data of a company is extremely valuable. An organization's success or failure is impacted by its ability to utilize the data it has to make well-informed decisions on business strategies and goals. It is the data managed
    in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other systems that is stored in relational databases that I work in often. I extract that data using SQL queries into reporting tools like Excel and Microsoft Power BI and then
    transform the raw data into clear, concise reporting and visualizations for the business users consumption. I have also worked extensively with business users to understand the possible functionality not currently being used of an ERP system to
    improve processes.</p>
